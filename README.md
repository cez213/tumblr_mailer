# tumblr_mailer

Fullstack Foundations Part 4

###OBJECTIVES

Create a Node.js file that will email a list of contacts my recent blog posts

###OVERVIEW

Here's a high-level overview of tasks we'll be accomplishing:

- Create another JavaScript file that can pull data from your Tumblr Blog
- Read in a CSV file of your friends' emails
- Load the content from some time-period of posts from your Tumblr blog
- Populate an email template with your blog content and mail merge it with your friends data
- Send the email using the Mandrill API

By the end of the project, you should be able to run a JavaScript file that will send out an email newsletter to a list of friends and family in your CSV file.
